      In the milky way galaxy there is a solar system that centers around a star that is called “The Sun”. Around “The Sun” orbits eight or nine planets. The third innermost planet is called “Earth”. </p>

      <p>It is mostly covered in water, and has a twenty four hour spin period.</p>

      <p>“Earth” is mostly covered in water, except for some bits that aren’t. These bits that aren’t mostly covered in water,  are mostly shaped by “Humans”. “Humans” like the “Earth” are also mostly water. </p>

      <p>Humans also are mostly confused. Some of them think that the world is round, some of them think the world is flat. </p>

      <p>Humans are best at dying. Most Humans are confused, but all die. So most Humans die confused. </p>

      <p>One confused “Human” that is currently walking around on one of the bits of the “Earth” that isn’t water is called “Grey Martin”. </p>

      <p>“Grey Martin” thinks that the world is round, so he is slightly less confused than some other humans. </p>
       
      <p>“Grey” thinks he is pretty good at coding for doing it for only 3 months, but “Grey” also thinks “Humans” are mostly confused. So “Grey” also thinks he might be confused about how good he is at coding. Which is confusing. </p>

      <p>“Grey” hopes when by the time he dies he will be less confused by coding.</p>

      <p> Hello, I'm Grey Martin, </p>
      <p> I am currently pursuing a career in the web coding world. </p>

      <p>My proficiencies include: </p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>Node</li>
      <li>Firebase</li>
      <li>MySql</li>
      <li>Mongo</li>
      <li>Mongoose</li>
      <li>MERN stacks</li> 
      </ul>

      <p>My marketable aspect is primarily how quickly I learned proficiency in the above mentioned technologies. Briefly stated, this BootCamp is definitely the hardest mental work of the entirety of my life, and I still have a curiosity that drives me to learn and master more. This is an example of that.</p>

      <p>The original idea was incited by my recognition that css was my weakest skill, simply because it doesn’t require much strength in css to use a Bootstrap library to get the display of a website to a functional point.</p>

      <p>Then my second bootcamp project needed me to shift to the front end a few days before the due date. We had set up basic functionality with Bootstrap and my only real goal was to present a project that didn’t look obviously like a product of Bootstrap.</p> 
      
      <p>When I  began jury rigging CSS onto that of Bootstrap, things quickly broke. I understand that using standardized technologies or libraries is the way to code both quickly and confidently but Bootstrap in particular just looks cheap to me. The average user may or may not notice a difference but I did and it irritated me.</p> 

      <p>Hence this project, which is an experiment of sorts, just trying to get creative and have fun at the same time.</p>

      <p>One thing I learned for sure is that design is harder than the backend.</p> 
      <p>By far.</p>
